# Virtual Pet
This is a programme to create virtual pets using JavaScript which I have made as part of Manchester Codes course.

# The pets will have the following features:
You can give them a name

They can get older

As they get older, they get hungrier and less fit

You can walk your pet to increase it's fitness.

You can feed your pet to decrease it's hunger. 

You can talk to your pet to see if it needs feeding or walking

If your pet gets too hungry or unfit, it will DIE 

If your pet gets to 30 days old it will DIE 

# Instructions
Fork this repository and clone down your fork.

Change into the cloned folder, and add you and your partner's remotes to you your local.

Run npm install to install the necessary libraries required for Node.js to run.
